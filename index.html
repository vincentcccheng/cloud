          <div>Germany's final three nuclear power plants close their doors on Saturday,marking the end of the country's nuclear era that has spanned more than six decades.</div>
          <div>Nuclear power has long been contentious in Germany.  There are those who want to end reliance on a technology they view as unsustainable,  dangerous and a distraction from speeding up renewable energy. </div>
          <div>But for others,closing down nuclear plants is short-sighted.They see it as turning off the tap on a reliable source of low-carbon energy at a time when drastic cuts to planet-heating pollution are needed.</div> 
          <div>Even as these debates rumble on,and despite last-minute calls to keep the plants online amid an energy crisis,the German government has been steadfast."The position of the German government is clear. Nuclear power is not green. Nor is it sustainable.</div>
