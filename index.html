          <li><a href="#" data-value="Germany.mp3">#1 - As usual, I received an update from each of my team member today about the tasks that they are working on.  One unfinished task was assigned 2 weeks ago, but it seems to have taken an extended period of time to complete.  I checked in with my team member Wilkins trying to see if there was anything I could do to help speed things up.   This is about making a data dashboard using a large set of leave records with data visibility filtered by different roles.  I noticed that Wilkins could have a different approach to assoicate the roles, and slice and dice the data in a much more easier and maintainable way.   I probably could have done it by myself in just a day.  There has been an apparent issue with his technical skill.  After I suggested a different approach, he seemed to feel a bit embrassed yet annoyed as he had spent 2 weeks on that and I denied his work in an hour.    I was very aware of that reaction and was trying to encourage him with some comforting words such as “your work was not an error but there’s just probably a better way to tackle it in a more maintainable way”.  In today's environment of understaffed situations, it requires more attention from leaders.   As a leader, you not only have to coach their work but also have to be very mindful about their mental reactions.   One bitter, unintentional expression could have led to the departure of a self-conscious team member.
